	<p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #19212d; font-weight:bold">Browsers History</span> The first web browser was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. He recruited a math student intern working at CERN. Her name was Nicola Pellow. She helped with the browser development by writing a Line Mode Browser. This was a cross-platform web browser that displayed web pages on dumb terminals. On May 1991, it was released. Web browsers can be accessed anywhere where there is Internet: phones, laptops, tablets, desktops, etc. They display text and images, but they have been programmed to display multimedia files such as video and audio as well. Plug-ins can be installed to help handle file types like flash animation and pdf documents. Web browsers are important because they help by quickly transporting information from all over the world. Internet Explorer and Google Chrome are two popular web browsers that are commonly used by people nowadays.</p>

	<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
	<p><img class="align-left" style="float:right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; background-color: #aaaaff; width: 250px; height: 250px; padding: 6px; border: 6px solid; margin: 10px;" src="InternetExplorer.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Internet Explorer"/></p>
	
	<p style="margin-right: 200px; font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;"> Microsoft created Internet Explorer on August 16, 1995. That is almost 23 years ago. Internet Explorer was updated to IE11 on February 13, 2018. It is currently running IE11 on Windows 10. In addition to the normal browser abilities, Internet Explorer offers several other features. One feature is called visual search providers. After installation, the visual search providers, this allows users to see suggestions for searches and a visual preview that includes a picture with some text description.</p><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;">Another feature that is offered is stats about the performance impact of add-ons. The browser monitors the performance of all add-ons and encourages users to disable those that slow things down. A user can use this feature to avoid slow browsing while using Internet Explorer. IE offers improved security to users by providing better identification and reporting malicious websites and downloads when compared to other browsers. Users can easily report malicious websites from the main interface of the browser.</p><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;"> By doing so, they will help increase the security for all users. Another feature that IE offers is power saving. While browsing on an unplugged laptop, IE allows users to slow their acceleration of hardware down a little. This will help increase the battery life for a little longer. Google Chrome is another popular web browser.

	<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
	<p><img class="align-right" style="float:left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; background-color: #ffffff; width: 250px; height: 250px; padding: 6px; border: 6px solid; margin: 10px;" src="GoogleChrome.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Google Chrome" /></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;">Google Chrome was created for the public on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP as a beta. The stable release to the public was on December 11, 2008. It used WebKit for rendering Web pages. This helped load pages really quickly. Chrome reads a lot of HTML code quickly, and it is able to handle good code well. Similar to Internet Explorer, Google Chrome has many additional features that separate it from other web browsers. </p><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;"> One feature is incognito mode. This allows users to browse the Web without appearing in browser or search history. No cookies will be left or any other traces of activity. The files that have been downloaded or bookmarked will be the only items saved. Chrome does not have a steep learning curve. It is very easy for users to switch to other browsers after using Chrome. This is because there is not much to learn about Chrome. After starting up the browser, users will be able to easily navigate the web quickly.</p><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;"> This user friendly browser also includes the pages that are frequently visited so the user has quick access to them. Chrome has its own task manager. This allows users to check processes which are active inside Chrome as well as how much memory CPU, and network resources they use. This feature can be accessed by the Chrome title bar. Users are allowed to drag tabs out and back again while browsing in Chrome. These are just a few of the special features that separate Google Chrome from Internet Explorer.</p>

	<p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 16px;">In conclusion, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer are two popular browsers that are used today to help quickly transport information from all over the world. Each of these browsers have special features that separate them from other browsers. There are many other browsers that can be installed on a computer. Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge are just a few other browsers being used. All of these browsers are important because they allow people to access information on the web.
