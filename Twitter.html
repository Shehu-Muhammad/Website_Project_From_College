						<p>Since the creation of the internet, online communication has become more and more prevalent. Many social media allow quick communication between two or more people via instant messaging. Twitter and Facebook are popular social media sites used by many of the youth of today to communicate and express their thoughts of the day. These sites not only allow you to talk to people that may be across the world, but they also allow you to share photos, videos, and play games with people on the website. In addition to being able to share photos and videos on one’s timeline, users can also post messages on their timelines to express to everyone on their friends list, depending on their privacy settings, how they are feeling or what’s new in their lives. These publicly visible posts may be liked, loved, laughed at, or may people feel sad. In some cases, they can be commented on or reported for being offensive.</p><p> 
						Twitter was created on March 21, 2006 by Jack Dorsey, the owner, and three other people. Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams helped Jack Dorsey create Twitter. It was created as a news and social networking service. The website is available in multiple languages to satisfy the needs or wants of the different languages offered in the world. Users are allowed to post and interact with messages. These messages are known as “tweets.” The original number of characters that these tweets were allowed was 140 characters. However, the limit was doubled November 7, 2017 to 280 characters allowing for longer tweets to be sent. If a user does not have a twitter account, they are not allowed to post tweets, but they are allowed to read the tweets. There is a Twitter app that can be installed on phones to allow users to access Twitter. Tweets are, by default, publicly visible, but users may restrict message delivery to just their followers. An analysis of tweets has shown that tweets can be separated into several different categories. According to Pear Analytics, Over seventy-five percent of tweets is pointless babble and conversational, while the rest of tweets are news, spam, self-promotion, and pass-along value. Tweets do not have to be words, they can also be pictures of something that the user finds funny or interesting.</p>

					<p>Instant messaging is a feature that many social media websites have integrated into their software. Instant messaging was created around the sametime as the Internet. In 1973, instant messaging was used to allow five people to chat simultaneously on a 512x512 plasma display. This allowed five lines of text to be sent as well as one more line to give the status line of the person who sent the message. Nowadays, instant messaging allows communication between two or more people over the Internet or other types of networks. It allows more than five people to speak to each other. Unlike email, it is effective and efficient communication due to the speed of the response. There are different types of instant messaging. It can be done like a message box on Facebook or Twitter, or it can be done with webcams. Also, people can talk directly for free over the Internet using a microphone and headphones or loudspeakers. People can also send a message with them speaking to a camera recording them and send that to someone. Snapchat is a newer social media application that allows this, and instagram does this through their story/video feature on their application.</p><p>In conclusion, online communication is used everyday by many people all over the world. Twitter and other social media allows this feature through their applications. Instant messaging and Twitter are not the same, but they both allow a similar type of quick communication between users.</p>
